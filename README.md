# Aqua
The now 6th version of my programming language, as attempt #5 ended pretty quickly as most needed to be redone.

Attempt 1: https://github.com/99TheDark/draw.js <br />
Attempt 2: https://github.com/99TheDark/Language <br />
Attempt 3: https://github.com/99TheDark/Bolt <br />
Attempt 4: https://github.com/99TheDark/Sulfur <br />
Attempt 5: https://github.com/99TheDark/Fusion <br />
Attempt 6: https://github.com/99TheDark/Aqua <br />

With each of these attempts, I try and improve on the last one. I also tend to swap languages, going from `JavaScript` to `JavaScript` to `TypeScript` to `Go` to `Rust` and finally now to `Nim`.
